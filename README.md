## Diary 

## 14/02  KNN 

I went through all the key steps of working with KNN:
✅ Installed the libraries
✅ Defined data and classes
✅ Trained the model
✅ Made predictions
✅ Experimented with K, coordinates, and classes.

Now I understand how the K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm works!

## 15/02 Linear Regression

Today, I practised using the Linear Regression algorithm. Throughout the process, I:


Installed the necessary libraries: numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.
Created a dataset where air temperature was used to predict the price of ice cream.


Plotted a graph of the original data to visually assess the relationship between temperature and price.


Trained a linear regression model using the fit method and generated a prediction line with predict.


Made a forecast for a new temperature (28°C) and found that the predicted ice cream price was approximately £4.68.


I'm pleased to have applied the theory in practice and to have seen how linear regression can be used to make predictions based on data. This experience has inspired me to continue exploring machine learning techniques!

## Neural Networks 

I built a simple neural network using the MLPClassifier. 

I started by creating a small dataset of 5×5 pixel images representing the digits 1 and 0. I prepared the data by flattening the images into one-dimensional arrays and then trained the model on these examples.

After training, I tested the model on the training data and also made a prediction using a slightly modified image of the digit 1. 

This exercise helped me understand how to work with neural networks using pixel data.
